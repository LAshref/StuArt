## HomeFragment.kt

Let's go through the usage of the overridden methods in the provided **HomeFragment**class:
**onCreateView(inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?): View**: This method is responsible for creating the view hierarchy associated with the fragment. In the provided code, this method is overridden to inflate the layout using the FragmentHomeBinding class and return the root view of the inflated layout.
**onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?)**: This method is called after the view has been created. In the provided code, this method is overridden to set up the ViewPager2 and TabLayout. It creates an adapter (HomeViewPageAdapter) for the ViewPager2 and connects it with the TabLayout using TabLayoutMediator. Inside the TabLayoutMediator setup, it dynamically updates the tab text based on the position of the fragment in the ViewPager2.
The **onCreateView** method is used to inflate the layout, while the **onViewCreated** method is used to set up the UI components and perform any necessary view-related operations after the view has been created.
These methods are crucial for initializing the UI components and setting up the interaction between the ViewPager2 and TabLayout to display different categories of items and dynamically update the tab text based on the position of the fragment.


In Android, the **inflate** method is used to create a new View hierarchy from the specified XML layout resource.
It takes an XML layout file and a **ViewGroup** container as input and **returns** the **root View of the inflated layout**.
The **LayoutInflater** class is used to instantiate the XML file into its corresponding View objects.
In the provided code, the inflate method is used in the **onCreateView** method to inflate the layout defined in the FragmentHomeBinding class.
This allows the fragment **to create its view hierarchy based on the specified layout resource**, which can then be accessed and manipulated programmatically.

Now, regarding the **binding** object, it is a part of the View Binding feature introduced in Android **to simplify the way of interacting with views**.
When View Binding is enabled for a module, **a binding class is generated for **each XML** layout file present in that module**.
This binding class contains references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.
In the provided code, the binding object is an instance of the FragmentHomeBinding class, which is auto-generated based on the layout file fragment_home.xml.

It allows direct access to the views defined in the layout **without the need for findViewById calls**, providing a type-safe way to interact with views.

So, in summary, inflate is used to create a view hierarchy from an XML layout resource, and binding is used to access the views within the inflated layout in a type-safe manner without the need for manual view lookups.

The ViewPager2 is a widget in the Android framework that allows users to swipe left and right through pages of data.

The **root** property of the binding class represents the root View of the inflated layout. This is the top-level View that contains the entire hierarchy of views defined in the layout file. It provides direct access to the root View, allowing you to manipulate or interact with the entire layout hierarchy.
In the provided code, **binding.root** is used to obtain the root View of the inflated layout defined in the **FragmentHomeBinding** class. This root View can then be used to set the content view for the fragment, as it is returned from the onCreateView method.
By using **binding.root**, you can access and manipulate the entire layout hierarchy defined in the XML file in a type-safe manner, without the need for manual view lookups using findViewById.


childFragmentManager: This attribute represents the FragmentManager that is responsible for managing the child fragments of the current fragment. When a fragment contains another fragment (child fragment), the childFragmentManager is used to handle the ... transactions, back stack, and the overall management of the child fragment's lifecycle.
In the context of the HomeViewPageAdapter, the childFragmentManager is passed to the adapter to indicate that it should use the childFragmentManager of the current fragment as the parent for managing the child fragments within the ViewPager2. This ensures that the child fragments are properly ... managed within the parent fragment's lifecycle.

In summary, childFragmentManager is used to manage the child fragments within the ViewPager2, and lifecycle is used to observe the lifecycle state of the current fragment and its child fragments within the ViewPager2.

# BUILD.Gradle file Explanation : 


###Plugins Section:
This section is used to apply various plugins to the project. These plugins extend the build system's capabilities and enable integration with different libraries and tools. In your build.gradle file, you are applying plugins for Android application, Kotlin, parcelize, Android Navigation Safe Args, Kotlin annotation processing, Dagger Hilt for Android, and Google Services.

  *com.android.application*:
This plugin is essential for building Android applications. It provides the necessary build tasks and default configurations required for an Android app. It's a fundamental plugin for any Android project.

*org.jetbrains.kotlin.android*:
This plugin adds Kotlin support to your Android project. It allows you to write Android applications using the Kotlin programming language. It provides Kotlin-specific tasks and configurations for the Android build process.

*kotlin-parcelize*:
This plugin is used to automatically generate Parcelable implementations for Kotlin classes. This is particularly useful when passing custom objects between components in Android, such as between activities or fragments.

*androidx.navigation.safeargs*:
This plugin is related to the Android Jetpack Navigation component. It generates code to enable type-safe navigation between destinations and to pass arguments safely between destinations.

*kotlin-kapt*:
This plugin is for Kotlin annotation processing. It allows Kotlin code to be processed during compilation, which is often used with libraries like Dagger for dependency injection.

*com.google.dagger.hilt.android*:
This plugin integrates Dagger Hilt into the Android build process. Dagger Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection.

*com.google.gms.google-services*:
